# Add Digits

Given a non-negative integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

**Example:** 
```
Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

**Follow up:** 
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

**Hint #1** 
A naive implementation of the above process is trivial. Could you come up with other methods?

**Hint #2** 
What are all the possible results?

**Hint #3** 
How do they occur, periodically or randomly?

**Hint #4**
