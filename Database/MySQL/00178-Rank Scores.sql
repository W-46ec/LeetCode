# Rank Scores

Table: `Scores` 
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| score       | decimal |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.
```

Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:
    - The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
    - If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
    - After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

Return the result table ordered by `score` in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.


**Example 1:** 
```
Input: 
Scores table:
+----+-------+
| id | score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+-------+------+
| score | rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```
